# python-supabase-table-data-gen-tool
A couple of scripts I wrote to help me dynamically generate fake data and load it into Supabase for a proof of concept I was working on. I wanted to use this opportunity to practice implementing an OOP programming approach. 

## Technologies Used:
* Python
* Faker library
* asyncio
* SQL
* Supabase
